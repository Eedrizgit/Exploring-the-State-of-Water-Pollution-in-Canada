# **CANADA WATER POLLUTION**

# Overview
Despite ongoing monitoring efforts, water quality data in Canada often remains underutilized in guiding actionable policy and community-level decisions. There is a gap in understanding how different pollutants, environmental parameters, and treatment statuses vary across provinces, agencies, and water sources. Without a clear analytical view of the patterns and severity of water contamination, stakeholders face difficulty in prioritizing interventions and allocating resources effectively.
# Objectives
This project seeks to bridge that gap by transforming raw water quality data into meaningful insights that can support environmental agencies, health departments, and policymakers in safeguarding Canada’s water future.

# Tools used
Power BI - data cleaning using power query, dashboard creation using cards, Q&A and slicers.
# Data
This data set includes Sample ID, Province, City, Date Collected, Water Source, Pollutant Type, Safe Limit (mg L), Pollutant Level (mg L), Exceeds Limit, pH Level, Temperature C, Turbidity NTU, Conductivity (uS cm), Dissolved Oxygen (mg L), and Treatment Status.

This data is relevant to the Environmental Monitoring and Water Management Industry. It plays a vital role in ensuring the provision of clean, safe drinking water, maintaining ecosystem health, and meeting regulatory compliance in public utilities, agriculture, and urban planning.

# In-Analysis observations and insights

1). A total of 3,000 water samples were examined, out of which 2,117 contained pollutant levels that exceeded the safe limits.

A striking 70.6% of water samples in Canada are contaminated beyond safe limits, indicating a widespread water pollution issue that requires immediate regulatory and environmental action. This suggests that most monitored water bodies pose potential health and ecological risks.

2). Saskatchewan Province recorded the highest number of polluted water samples, with a total of 313.

Saskatchewan stands out as a critical pollution hotspot. This may indicate either industrial/agricultural contamination or insufficient local water protection policies, making it a key target for enforcement, monitoring, and treatment investment.

3). EnviroCan was responsible for the highest number of water sources (780), accounting for 26% of the total, while HydroWatch managed the least, with 713 sources, approximately 23.77% of the total.

Though the difference is marginal, EnviroCan oversees the largest share (26%) of national water sources, suggesting their practices and performance may significantly influence national water safety outcomes. Agencies with fewer assigned sources, like HydroWatch, may still manage areas of concern and should not be overlooked.

4). Microplastics topped the list of pollutants that exceeded the safe limit, appearing in 260 samples, while oil was the least common, found in 207 samples.

Microplastics have become the leading pollutant, highlighting the growing environmental impact of consumer plastic waste on Canadian water systems. Oil contamination is comparatively lower but still a notable pollutant, possibly tied to industrial runoff or transport spills.

5). Although Saskatchewan had the highest number of polluted water samples, Manitoba ranked first in terms of water samples exceeding safe limits, with a total of 228.

Manitoba’s water may be more severely polluted or have pollutants that more frequently cross critical thresholds, whereas Saskatchewan may have more frequent but less extreme pollution cases. It highlights the difference between pollution presence and pollution severity.

6). New Brunswick Province recorded the lowest number of samples exceeding safe limits, with 186.

New Brunswick may have better water quality control measures or less exposure to high-risk pollution sources. It could serve as a benchmark province for effective water safety practices.

7). New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador had the lowest number of untreated water samples, at 92 and 93 respectively. In contrast, Manitoba and Alberta had the highest, with 123 and 112 untreated samples respectively.

A high number of untreated water sources in these provinces signals insufficient water treatment infrastructure, which could lead to direct exposure to contaminants, especially dangerous where pollution exceeds safe limits.

8). Manitoba and New Brunswick had the fewest partially treated water samples, with 90 and 95 respectively. On the other hand, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador had the highest numbers, with 114 and 109 respectively.

A reliance on partial treatment may indicate budgetary, technical, or capacity limitations in these provinces’ water treatment systems. It also raises concerns about residual contaminants still reaching public or ecological use.

9). New Brunswick, Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Quebec had the lowest number of treated water samples, with 86, 87, 88, and 88 respectively. Conversely, Ontario and Saskatchewan recorded the highest, with 109 and 106 treated samples respectively.

This suggests that Ontario and Saskatchewan are leading in full treatment coverage, while provinces like New Brunswick and Nova Scotia may be under-treating their water, potentially exposing residents to risk if pollution levels are high.

10). Manitoba recorded the highest average pollutant level among all provinces.

# Recommendation

1). Continue and Expand Monitoring Programs

With 2,117 out of 3,000 samples exceeding safe limits (70.6%), Canada must not only treat water but maintain robust, continuous monitoring and public reporting by

i)   Expanding the scope and frequency of sample collection.

ii)  Creating an open-access public water quality dashboard.

iii) Engaging communities through citizen science initiatives.

2). Strengthen Pollution Control in High-Risk Provinces

Focus immediate regulatory and cleanup efforts in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Prince Edward Island, as these provinces recorded the highest average pollutant levels (above 25 mg/L), high numbers of waters exceeding safe limits, with Saskatchewan (313), Manitoba (306), and PEI (304) polluted waters. Canada should

i)   Increase frequency of inspections and sampling in industrial and agricultural zones.

ii)  Mandate stricter discharge regulations and enforce penalties for polluters.

iii) Launch targeted public education campaigns in high-risk regions.

3). Target Microplastics as a National Priority Pollutant

Since microplastics were the most common pollutant exceeding safe limits (260 samples) across nearly all provinces, they should be addressed as a national environmental threat by

i)   Banning or limiting single-use plastics where feasible.

ii)  Upgrading water filtration infrastructure to capture microplastics.

iii) Encouraging corporate responsibility in plastic production and disposal.

4). Improve Water Treatment Coverage in Manitoba and Alberta

Manitoba and Alberta have the highest number of untreated waters (123 and 112 respectively), indicating a gap in water infrastructure or response capability.

i)   Allocate federal or provincial funding to upgrade water treatment facilities.

ii)  Deploy mobile or temporary treatment solutions in high-risk rural areas.

iii) Prioritize these regions in water safety improvement plans.

5). Expand Full Treatment Programs in Low-Coverage Provinces

New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Alberta, and Quebec have the lowest treated water counts (under 89 each). Given their pollution levels, full treatment coverage is necessary.

i)   Transition partially treated systems to full treatment solutions.

ii)  Conduct audits on water treatment facilities for performance and capacity.

iii) Train local agencies on best practices for full-spectrum water purification.

6). Leverage Best Practices from New Brunswick and Newfoundland

Although not without issues, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador show relatively better average pollutant levels and lowest untreated water samples (92 and 93 respectively).

i)   Conduct case studies on operational models in these provinces.

ii)  Replicate successful policies and community initiatives in other provinces.

iii) Use their data as benchmarks in inter-provincial water quality improvement frameworks.

7). Review and Rebalance Agency Assignments

EnviroCan and HydroWatch together manage 49.8% of Canada’s water sources. However, disparities in pollution severity within their jurisdictions suggest a need to review agency resource allocation and accountability.

i)   Introduce a national performance dashboard for all agencies.

ii)  Ensure staffing, equipment, and funding match agency workloads and risk zones.

iii) Consider redistributing water source responsibilities based on pollution intensity and treatment gaps.

8). Conduct Targeted Pollutant Remediation Campaigns by Province

Each province shows unique pollutant profiles (e.g., Microplastics in Saskatchewan & PEI, Pathogens in Quebec & Ontario, Phosphate in Manitoba).

i)   Launch region-specific pollutant mitigation programs (e.g., agricultural runoff controls in Manitoba).

ii)  Implement localized awareness programs for industries and residents.

iii) Support innovation in pollutant-specific filtration technologies.

9). Investigate Prince Edward Island’s High Turbidity and Temperature

PEI Province recorded the highest average turbidity (52.01 NTU) and highest average water temperature (16.09°C), both of which can affect aquatic life and water quality stability.

i)   Monitor climate change influence on water parameters.

ii)  Introduce vegetation buffers and erosion control near water bodies.

iii) Explore cooling and turbidity-reducing treatments for reservoirs and open sources.

10). Encourage Federal-Provincial Collaboration on Water Safety

Given the inconsistencies in treatment levels, pollution types, and agency oversight, a unified national strategy is needed.

i)   Establish a Canada-wide Water Quality Improvement Framework.

ii)  Promote joint funding and data-sharing initiatives between provinces.

iii) Standardize treatment protocols and pollution threshold guidelines.
